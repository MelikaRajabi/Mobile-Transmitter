# Mobile-Transmitter
In this Project, we have designed and simulated parts of a mobile system transmitter. It contains a balanced amplifier, a microstrip bandpass filter (6th order chebyshev), and a plannar F-inverted antenna. The softwares we used for simulation are ADS and HFSS. MATLAB is also used for computations.
